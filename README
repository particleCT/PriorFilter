Prior Filter

Particle CT filter using a prior reconstruction to determine the likelihood of a particle's path occuring from only electromagnetic interactions

Compile by running source compile.sh

Prerequesite:
- Geant4
- ROOT

## Main Code 
An example command to run is

```shell script
./bin/PriorFilter projection_file prior_file ion
```

The variables respectively mean:

-projection_file : ROOT file containing the single-tracking particle acquisitoin with the full output (x0,x1, y0, y1, z0, z1, px0, px1, py0, py1, pz0, pz1, wepl)
-prior_file   : ROOT file containing the prior reconstruction for determineing the energy loss through the object. Looks for TH3D called 'RSP'
-ion    : Ion species used for imaging this dataset. Currently implemented H and He
